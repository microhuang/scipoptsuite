Adding new tests
----------------

When adding a new unittest, this should be called unittest-<name>
For example, unittest-new. You should create a folder called
unittest-new
and inside put the unittest-new.c/cpp (which should contain the main)
and all the extra files (without restriction on the name)

Modifying the Makefile
----------------------

Suppose you created your new unittest, unittest-new, and assume
the folder src/unittest-new contains the following files
unittest-new.c misc.c misc.h more_misc.c

Then you should add unittest-new to the list on UNITTESTS
and add unittest-new/misc unittest-new/more_misc to the list
on EXTRASRC.
