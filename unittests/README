Adding new tests
----------------

When adding a new unittest, this should be called unittest-<name>
For example, when creating unittest-xyz, you should create a folder called
unittest-xyz and put the unittest-xyz.c/cpp (which should contain the main)
and all the extra files (without restriction on the name) inside

Modifying the Makefile
----------------------

Suppose you created your new unittest, unittest-xyz, and assume
the folder src/unittest-xyz contains the following files
unittest-xyz.c misc.c misc.h more_misc.c

Then you should add unittest-xyz to the list on UNITTESTS
and add unittest-xyz/misc unittest-xyz/more_misc to the list
on EXTRASRC.

Running tests
----------------
Just excecute make test with the options you want, for instance,
make LPS=cpx OPT=opt test
