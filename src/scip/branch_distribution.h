/**@file   branch_distribution.h
 * @brief  probability based branching rule based on an article by *J. Pryor* and *J.W. Chinneck*
 * @author Gregor Hendel
 *
 * The distribution branching rule selects a variable based on its impact on row activity distributions. More formally,
 * let \f$ a(x) = a_1 x_1 + \dots + a_n x_n \leq b \f$ be a row of the LP. Let further \f$ l_i, u_i \in R\f$ denote the
 * (finite) lower and upper bound, respectively, of the \f$ i \f$-th variable \f$x_i\f$.
 * Viewing every variable \f$x_i \f$ as (continuously) uniformly distributed within its bounds, we can approximately
 * understand the row activity \f$a(x)\f$ as a gaussian random variate with mean value \f$ \mu = E[a(x)] = \sum_i a_i\frac{l_i + u_i}{2}\f$
 * and variance \f$ \sigma^2 = \sum_i a_i^2 \frac{(u_i - l_i)^2}{12} \f$.
 * With these two parameters, we can calculate the probability to satisfy the row in terms of the cumulative distribution
 * of the standard normal distribution: \f$ P(a(x) \leq b) = \Phi(\frac{b - \mu}{\sigma})\f$.
 *
 * The impact of a variable on the probability to satisfy a constraint after branching can be estimated by altering
 * the variable contribution to the sums described above. In order to keep the tree size small,
 * variables are preferred which decrease the probability
 * to satisfy a row because it is more likely to create infeasible subproblems.
 *
 * The selection of the branching variable is subject to the parameter `scoreparam`. For both branching directions,
 * an individual score is calculated. Available options for scoring methods are:
 * largest 'd'ifference, 'l'owest cumulative probability,'h'ighest c.p., 'v'otes lowest c.p., votes highest c.p.('w')
 * - _d_ : select a branching variable with largest difference in satisfaction probability after branching
 * - _l_ : lowest cumulative probability amongst all variables on all rows (after branching).
 * - _h_ : highest cumulative probability amongst all variables on all rows (after branching).
 * - _v_ : highest number of votes for lowering row probability for all rows a variable appears in.
 * - _w_ : highest number of votes for increasing row probability for all rows a variable appears in.
 *
 * If the parameter `usescipscore` is set to `TRUE`, a single branching score is calculated from the respective
 * up and down scores as defined by the SCIP branching score function (see advanced branching parameter `scorefunc`),
 * otherwise, the variable with the single highest score is selected, and the maximizing direction is assigned
 * higher branching priority.
 *
 * The original idea of probability based branching schemes appeared in:
 *
 * *J. Pryor and J.W. Chinneck* (2011),
 * [Faster Integer-Feasibility in Mixed-Integer Linear Programs by Branching to Force Change]
 * (http://www.sce.carleton.ca/faculty/chinneck/docs/PryorChinneck.pdf),
