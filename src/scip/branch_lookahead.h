 * @brief  lookahead LP branching rule
 * @author Christoph Schubert
 *
 * The (multi-level) lookahead branching rule applies strong branching to every fractional value of the LP solution
 * at the current node of the branch-and-bound tree, as well as recursivly to every temporary childproblem created by this
 * strong branching. The rule selects the candidate with the best proven dual bound.
 *
 * For a more mathematical description and a comparison between lookahead branching and other branching rules
 * in SCIP, we refer to
