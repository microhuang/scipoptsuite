We provide all needed libraries on http://scip.zib.de/#download to run the JNI on a Windows system. Please make sure
that you are using a 64bit version of Java.

The following steps explain how to run the SCIP JniKnapsack examlple on Windows.

1.) copy the JniKnapsack.java into a new Java project; the file can be found here:

     <scipdir>/interfaces/jni/examples/JniKnapsack/java/JniKnapsack.java

2.) add the scip.jar as an external JAR (for Eclipse: Properties > Java Build Path > Add External Jars)

3.) put the libjscip*.{dll,lib} and libscip-*.{dll,lib} next to the scip.jar or inside the main directory of your new project

4.) replace the line JniScipLibraryLoader.loadLibrary(); in JniKnapsack.java with System.loadLibrary("libjscip-0.1.mingw.x86_64.msvc.opt.spx");

5.) execute your program as a Java application
