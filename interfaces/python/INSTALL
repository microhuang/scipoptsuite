Building python-scip
====================

Before building the python-scip wrapper, you need to download the SCIP
Optimization Suite from http://scip.zib.de.
After extracting the archive, build the shared library with

    make SHARED=true ZIMPL=false scipoptlib

which should appear in "lib/libscipopt-3.0.2.linux.x86_64.gnu.opt.so".
This library should be found in your LD_LIBRARY_PATH, e.g.,

    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:<path_to_scipopt/lib>

additionally, it is necessary to append the path to this directory to
your PYTHONPATH, e.g.,

   export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:<path_to_python-scip>

Then, back in the python-scip directory, execute

    python setup.py build_ext --inplace

which should result in a file pyscipopt/scip/scip.so, which you can
now import directly in your Python code.


To test the library, simply run "py.test".
