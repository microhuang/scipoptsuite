Building the Python interface
=============================

The SCIP Python interface uses the shared library of the SCIP Optimization Suite.
Therefore you have to run

    make SHARED=true scipoptlib

from the root of the SCIP Optimization directory. This will result in the creation
of the directory "<path_to_scipopt/lib>" and the shared library "libscipopt.so".

From within the directory "interfaces/python", please execute the following command:

    python setup.py install

You may use the additional options "--user" or "--prefix=<custom-python-path>",
to build the interface locally.

The interface is written in Cython. If you have Cython installed on your system,
the interface will be built from scratch. Otherwise the included pre-built C-code
will be used.

TROUBLESHOOTING
===============

The installation routine tries to generate symbolic links to the "scipopt" library as
well as to the "src" directory of SCIP. In case of installation problems you should
verify the correctness of the links in the directories "lib" and "include".

Note:
-----
You cannot use the interface module from within the "interfaces/python" directory. This
is because Python will try to import the pyscipopt module locally instead of using
the installed one.
