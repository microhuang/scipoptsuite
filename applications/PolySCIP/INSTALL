PolySCIP uses data structures of the Lemon Graph Library (https://lemon.cs.elte.hu/trac/lemon).

Lemon as well as PolySCIP use cmake. Make sure you have cmake (https://cmake.org/)
installed (preferably a version >= 3.0). 

1.) Download the Lemon Graph Library and follow the steps given in its INSTALL file. 
(In case of compilations problems, use a cmake version >= 3.0 and try
to execute 'cmake .. -DLEMON_ENABLE_SOPLEX=no' instead of just 'cmake ..'.)
After you have installed Lemon, proceed to 2.)

2.) Build SCIP and SoPlex.
(If you have downloaded the SCIP Optimisation Suite at
http://scip.zib.de/#scipoptsuite, then it should be enough to build
SCIP and SOPLeX via 'make scipoptlib' or 'make scipoptlib SHARED=true', respectively.) 

If you have built SCIP (and SOPLEX) successfully, you are ready to build PolySCIP.
Proceed to 3.)

3) Change into the PolySCIP directory. 

4.) Execute 'mkdir build' followed by 'cd build'

5.a) If Lemon was installed globally at /usr/local,

execute 'cmake ..'

If Lemon was not installed at /usr/local, but a user-specified path, see 5.b)

5.b) Specify the Lemon include directory via the variable -DLEMON_INC= 

E.g, if Lemon is installed on your machine at /home/user/lemon and, hence,
its include directory is located at /home/user/lemon/include, then

execute 'cmake .. -DLEMON_INC=/home/user/lemon/include' 

PolySCIP tries to locate all other necessary includes and libraries. 
In case of other errors, it is also possible to specifiy the path to the 
SCIP directory on the command line:

Assume that the SCIP directory is located at '/home/user/scipoptsuite-3.2.1/scip-3.2.1'.
Then you can specify the root directory of SCIP via -DSCIP_ROOT_DIR= and, in this case,
execute 'cmake .. -DLEMON_INC=/home/user/lemon/include -DSCIP_ROOT_DIR=/home/user/scipoptsuite-3.2.1/scip-3.2.1'

6.) Execute 'make' 

If there occur (linker) problems, then try to compile SoPlex and SCIP
with the least possible dependencies, i.e., rebuild SoPlex with 'make GMP=false' and 
rebuild SCIP with 'make ZLIB=false READLINE=false GMP=false'.
Then try again to build PolySCIP as described in 5.)

7.) Execute 'make doc' to build the doxygen documentation in the 'doc' directory
