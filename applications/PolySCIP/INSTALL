PolySCIP uses data structures of the Lemon Graph Library (https://lemon.cs.elte.hu/trac/lemon).

Lemon as well as PolySCIP use cmake. Make sure you have cmake (https://cmake.org/) installed. 

1.) Download the Lemon Graph Library (http://lemon.cs.elte.hu/trac/lemon/) and 
follow the steps given in the INSTALL file. 
(You might need cmake version >= 3.0. Furthermore, in case 
of compilations problems you might have to execute 
'cmake .. -DLEMON_ENABLE_SOPLEX=no' before 'make' instead of just 'cmake ..'.)

2.) After you have built SCIP and SoPlex successfully (see their respective INSTALL files), 
you are ready to build PolySCIP. 

3) Change into the PolySCIP directory. 

4.) Execute 'mkdir build' and 'cd build'

5.a) Execute 'cmake ..'

If Lemon was installed at /usr/local, the above command should work. In case of problem, see 5.b)

5.b) Execute 'cmake .. -DLEMON_INC=/home/user/lemon/include' 

where '/home/user/lemon/include' is a place holder for the path to the lemon include on _your_
machine. 

cmake tries to locate all other necessary includes and libraries. 
In case of other errors, it is also possible to specifiy the paths to the 
necessary libraries on the command line:

Assume that the SCIP directory is located at '/home/user/scipoptsuite-3.2.1/scip-3.2.1'.
Then you can also execute 
'cmake .. -DLEMON_INC=/home/user/lemon/include -DSCIP_ROOT_DIR=/home/user/scipoptsuite-3.2.1/scip-3.2.1'

6.) Execute 'make' 

If there still occur (linker) problems, then try to compile SoPlex and SCIP with the least 
possible dependencies, i.e., 
rebuild SoPlex with 'make GMP=false' or
and 
rebuild SCIP with 'make ZLIB=false READLINE=false GMP=false' and/or 'make SHARED=true'
and 
try again to build PolySCIP as described in 5.)

7.) Execute 'make doc' to build the doxygen documentation in the 'doc' directory
