PolySCIP uses data structures of the Lemon Graph Library (https://lemon.cs.elte.hu/trac/lemon).

Lemon as well as PolySCIP use cmake. Make sure you have cmake (https://cmake.org/) installed. 

1.) Download the Lemon Graph Library (http://lemon.cs.elte.hu/trac/lemon/) and 
follow the steps given in the INSTALL file.

2.) After you have built SCIP and SoPlex successfully (see their INSTALL files), change into the PolySCIP
directory 

3.) Execute 'mkdir build' and 'cd build'

4.a) Execute 'cmake ..'

cmake tries to locate the necessary includes and libraries. In case of errors, it is also possible to 
specifiy the necessary includes and library paths on the command line:

Assume Lemon was installed at '/home/user/lemon' and its include directory can be found at 
'/home/user/lemon/include'. 
Furthermore assume that the SCIP directory is located at '/home/user/scipoptsuite-3.2.1/scip-3.2.1' 
and the SoPlex directory is located at '/home/user/scipoptsuite-3.2.1/soplex-2.2.1'.

4.b) Execute 'cmake .. -DLEMON_INC=/home/user/lemon -DSCIP_ROOT_DIR=/home/user/scipoptsuite-3.2.1/scip-3.2.1 -DSOPLEX_ROOT_DIR=/home/user/scipoptsuite-3.2.1/soplex-2.2.1'

(If there still occur linker problems, then SoPlex and SCIP was probably linked with ZLIB, GMP or READLINE support. Rebuild SoPlex and SCIP via 'make ZLIB=false READLINE=false GMP=false')

5.) Execute 'make' to build the executable in the PolySCIP directory

6.) Execute 'make doc' to build the doxygen documentation in the 'doc' directory
