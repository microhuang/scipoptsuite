PolySCIP
=====================================================================

PolySCIP is a solver for multi-criteria integer programming as well as
multi-criteria linear programming. The name PolySCIP is composed of
Poly (from the Greek πολύς meaning "many") and SCIP.  The current
version of PolySCIP computes the so-called non-dominated extreme
points of the problem instance. Its file format .mop is based on the
.mps file format.
